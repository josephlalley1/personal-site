        <p>At 13 years old, I launched a MineCraft server, where I experienced
          my first need for web development. I needed a website to represent the
          server and didnâ€™t have the money to pay a developer, so I learned.</p>
        <p>After creating a basic HTML and CSS landing page for the server,
          I was fascinated with development. This fascination with how things
          were created followed me, and eventually pushed me to pursue the Web
          Development Immersive course at General Assembly.</p>
